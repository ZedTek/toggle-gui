DISCLAIMER! PLEASE READ!:
Toggle (OSS and proprietary versions) is provided AS-IS, with no warranty, express or implied, under ANY circumstances.
Support may be given, however it is not guaranteed.

Toggle gives users the option to import arbitrary code and run it alongside Toggle (Toggle Modules). To ensure the 
security of your system, ensure the following:

* Make sure that you trust the developer of said module(s).
* Read through the code of the module(s) to ensure there is no malicious intent.
* If your module does things that you don't know how to do or undo yourself, you shouldn't probably be using it.
* BEST PRACTICE: Run Toggle on a device separate from your main working computer. We suggest a Raspberry Pi for this.

ZedTek, its affiliates, and its contributors assume no responsibility for any damages caused by your use of Toggle. 
You use the software at your own risk, and you agree not to hold the developers of Toggle liable for any damages, 
including, but not limited to: System Corruption, Data Loss, Data Leaking, Stolen Documents, or Physical Damages. 
We hope none of these happen to you, however we aren't in control of third-party developers.
